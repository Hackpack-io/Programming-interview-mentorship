Affordable coding interview preparation from FAANG engineers


As anyone who has ever gone through a programming interview knows, they can be incredibly challenging. Even if you're well-prepared, the pressure of the situation can sometimes lead to mistakes. That's why having a mentor to help you through the process can be so valuable. However, finding someone who is both knowledgeable and affordable can be difficult.

That's why I'm excited to intro Hackpack as an affordable programming interview community with vetted mentors baked in. We know what it takes to succeed in a coding interview. We'll work with you to help you build the critical skills (Data Structures and Algorithms, System Design, Behavioral) and build your confidence so that you can go into your interview with the best possible chance of success.
